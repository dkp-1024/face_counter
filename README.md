This was my minor project of 6th semester. 
It is based on the concept of Image processing, and Computer vision. 
Our aim in this project was to count total number of human faces in any Image. 
We used OpenCV library for Image processing and PIL for image editing. 

TODO - 
Make faces automatically crop and then move them another folder.
